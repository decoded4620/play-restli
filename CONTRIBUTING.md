Tips for Getting Your Pull Request Accepted
===========================================

1. Make sure all new features are tested and the tests pass.
2. Bug fixes must include a test case demonstrating the error that it
   fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before
   submitting a pull request. Large features which have never been
   discussed are unlikely to be accepted.
